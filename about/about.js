      <h4>A Magic: The Gathering tool kit written in JavaScript.</h4>
      <br />
      <h2>Planechase</h2>
      <p>We wanted to create tools for players who wanted to look through the
      planechase cards and build sample planechase decks to hone their skills
      as a planeswalker.</p>

      <p>This tool allows players to:</p>
      <p> › look though all the planes in random order</p>
      <p> › build a decklist of planes for planechase games (comming soon)</p>

      <h2>Search</h2>
      <p>To give the players full access to information they may need during a
      game, we put together the most comprehensive search tool we could so that
      players have access to every card and every ruling to ensure games go as smoothly
      as possible. Here players can find all the information they ever wanted to
      know about any card they can think of quickly, without leaving the plane -
      or their tools behind. Speaking of tools...</p>

      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>The tools page give players the ability to track all the accounting the game requires with out need their Pound-O-Dice, every where they go.</p>

      <p>You can track all the things you could think of and more, including:</p>
      <p>› life total</p>
      <p>› poison counters</p>
      <p>› loyalty counters</p>
      <p>› suspend counters</p>
      <p>› sheep counters</p>
      <p>› any and all other counters including custom counters</p>
