# Git Cheatsheet

## Basic get workflow
* Files are changed. Those files are "modified".
* Modified files can be added to the current commit by using `git add yourFileName`
* These files are now "staged"
* When all the changes are ready, the changes can be "committed" by using `git commit -m "Your message that describes the commit."`
* Finally, those changes can be pushed up to github using `git push`.


## Adding New Files
After you add a new file, use `git add YOUR_NEW_FILE_NAME` .
